# Non-Euclidian-Minecraft
This is a rudimentary recreation of Minecraft with a flavor of Non-Euclidian geometry. The whole environment of cubes creates a procedurally generated sphere which the player can traverse, destroy and build upon as they wish. At the center of the planet, you'll find a purplish colored brick that represents the gravitational core of the planet.

To try this experience yourself, simply download the playable Unity game from the release section of this repository or download a zip of this project, whichever you prefer, the content is the same in both.
