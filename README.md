# Non-Euclidian-Minecraft
This is a rudimentary recreation of Minecraft with a flavor of Non-Euclidian geometry. The whole environment of cubes creates a procedurally generated sphere which the player can traverse, destroy and build upon as they wish. At the center of the planet, you'll find a purplish colored brick that represents the gravitational core of the planet.
